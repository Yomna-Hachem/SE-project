    <p>Our pedodontists strive to spread healthy smiles by the delivery of quality and safe dental care in an environment that is as pleasant as possible for children and that promotes a positive attitude toward oral health and future dental care ; the most significant difference between pediatric and adult dentistry is the need for dentists treating children to understand and practice psychological principles in order to provide children with positive, relatively pain-free experiences in this important health area. Bad memories of traumatic dental therapy as a child can negatively influence children and cause them to reject adequate dental care for the rest of their lives. Unlike adults, Kids cannot always sit still and cooperate during a dental exam or teeth cleaning. Our dentists understand this and specialize in letting treatments be more comfortable in addition to the special equipment and decorations available in our clinic that appeal to younger patients. Added to that, we provide areas dedicated to children's games, which aids in overcoming dental phobia. Above it all,  our aim is to teach parents and kids the importance of creating good habits that will last a lifetime. </p>
